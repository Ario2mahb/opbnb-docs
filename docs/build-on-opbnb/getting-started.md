# Overview

Developing on opBNB is nearly the same as building directly on BNB Smart Chain. Migration from Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible chains to opBNB will be nearly seamless for projects. Some key points to highlight:

1. Optimistic rollup - opBNB provides the scalability and low costs of a rollup, while still leveraging the security of BNB Smart Chain. dApps get the best of both Layer 1 and Layer 2.
2. EVM Compatible - Developers on any EVM campatible chains can simply deploy the same application on opBNB to get the benefits of Layer 2 scaling.
