title: Infra and Tooling Readiness 
index: yes
---

One of our main objectives is to expand the adoption and utility of opBNB as a high performance and low cost Layer 2 chain on the BNB Smart Chain. To achieve this goal, we have to ensure that our underlying technology is robust, scalable and user-friendly. That is why we are committed to developing and improving the core infrastructure and tools that support opBNB and its community of users, hosts and developers. Below are the ecosystem we are building for the opBNB.

# For All dApps

**Binance Exchange Support** 

Binance has supported deposit and withdrawal on **7th Nov**. The initial list is BNB, FDUSD, and USDT as a start. 

**Node Providers** 

Needless to mention that the stability of RPC nodes is crucial to any blockchain, in this instance BNB Chain has **NodeReal** who is one of opBNB early and core contributors to anchor this task. 

NodeReal RPC can be accessed through their [API marketplace](https://nodereal.io/api-marketplace/explore?chains=opbnb). For common/public nodes, communities can access[ BNB ChainList](https://www.bnbchainlist.org/). 

**Wallet** 

Crypto/Digital wallet serves as an entry point for users to access blockchain. opBNB have known wallets providing access to opBNB such as [Metamask and Trustwallet](https://docs.bnbchain.org/opbnb-docs/docs/build-on-opbnb/wallet-configuration), leading the front. 

On **Account Abstraction(AA)**, [CyberConnect](https://cyberconnect.me/), [Particle Network](https://wallet.particle.network/), [Biconomy](https://docs.biconomy.io/supportedchains/) has already integrated with opBNB. 

**MultiSig** wallet BNB Chain has provided its own [Safe Multi-Sig Wallet](https://docs.bnbchain.org/opbnb-docs/docs/build-on-opbnb/multisig-wallet). 

**Bridges** 

For bridges opBNB has its own default [bridge](https://opbnb-bridge.bnbchain.org/deposit), which is built mirroring OP Stack. This also means that it has the 7 days challenge period, similar to OP bridge, BASE bridge. But opBNB does have 3rd party bridge providers, such as [Polyhedra](https://zkbridge.com/opbnb) and [Rhino.Fi](https://app.rhino.fi/bridge?token=BNB&chainOut=OPBNB&chain=BINANCE) that provide shorter withdrawal periods. 

**Data Analytics**

Several known industry platform already started supporting opBNB, i.e. [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/opBNB) , [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/opbnb), [DappBay](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/ranking/chain/opbnb). For listing on DappBay, projects can fill up this [form](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/submit-dapp).

**Indexing** 

opBNB currently has NodeReal’s opBNB Graph QL as the initial support[**Beta Version**] as current players such as TheGraph have their pipeline full for the rest of the year. For projects needing such services, projects can liaise with NodeReal on specs, requirements. [[Process Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R0RcHKU27lBPMaSmwhwijlXLTQhs0Haa9LtKsxJbeAc/edit)]

**DAO** 

Essential component as the BNB Chain moves towards decentralization. [XDao](https://www.xdao.app/204) and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/?filter=networks&q=opbnb) are now supporting opBNB. 

# For DeFi Specific

**Oracle** 

[Binance Oracle](https://oracle.binance.com/docs/) has started supporting opBNB since Day1. Feel free to reach Binance Oracle for product support and demo.

# For Game/Social Media

**VRF** 

[Binance Oracle](https://oracle.binance.com/docs/vrf/overview) has support for opBNB VRF. Feel free to reach Binance Oracle for product support and demo. 

**NFT Marketplace & Minting** 

[Element’s NFT Marketplace](https://element.market/opbnb) is already live on opBNB. Minting feature will be ready soon in Nov.
